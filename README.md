# 🫐 Wild Blueberry Yield Prediction 🌱

How can we optimize blueberry yield using data? This project explores machine learning techniques to predict wild blueberry yield based on various environmental and soil factors.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This dataset, sourced from Kaggle, provides insights into agricultural productivity by analyzing conditions that impact blueberry growth. Our goal is to develop a predictive model that helps farmers and researchers make data-driven decisions for improving crop yield.

## 📊 Dataset Details

The dataset contains 17 features related to:

-🌡️ Weather Conditions (temperature, precipitation, etc.)

-🌱 Soil Attributes (pH, organic matter, etc.)

-💦 Moisture Levels (water availability & saturation)

-🌾 Agricultural Practices (fertilization, irrigation)

Our task is to analyze these variables and build an ML model that accurately predicts wild blueberry yield.

## 🎯 Key Objectives

✅ Develop a regression model to predict blueberry yield.
✅ Identify key environmental factors affecting crop production.
✅ Provide explainable AI insights for better agricultural decision-making.

## 🌍 Why It Matters

Understanding these patterns can help optimize farming strategies, increase yield, and promote sustainable agriculture.
